# Momiji

This is a library that provides practical middleware and types that make the
[Oak](https://github.com/oakserver/oak) framework very easy to use.

## Middlewares

| Middleware                                                                                   | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [cors](https://github.com/cat394/Momiji/tree/main/packages/middlewares/cors)                 | Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support for Oak.            |
| [query-parser](https://github.com/cat394/Momiji/tree/main/packages/middlewares/query-parser) | Creates a state by parsing the query parameters.                 |
| [validator]                                                                                  | Validate the request body and query parameters using middleware. |

We have also released
[several modules](https://github.com/cat394/Momiji/tree/main/packages/utility-types)
(only one as of August 14, 2024) that help with type safety in Typescript.
